1. ??? (Make changes?)
1. Push the changes to GitHub

## The development process

All development happens on GitHub—there exists the possibility of brainstorming happening outside of GitHub, but an attempt should be made to convey all design decisions in a GitHub issue or Pull Request.

### `master` should be stable

The `master` branch should always contain a stable version of the project, with (passing) tests, and decent test coverage.

### Issues

Issue should be used liberally. Example usage:

- Brainstorming and ideas
- General discussion
- Actual issues (e.g. bugs)

### Pull Requests

(See also: "`master` should be stable" above for information about branches.)

Pull Requests are the means by which branches are merged into `master`. Open a Pull Request and describe what changes are being introduced.

### Style Guide

To be described—try to keep with the style of the document.
